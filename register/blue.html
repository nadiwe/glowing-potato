                and four speakers arranged in space, a unique sound experience is created. By interacting with the
                pedestal
                or rotating the sphere in space, the user can change and explore the soundscape around them.The
                installation
                is divided into two sound worlds. They are fundamentally opposed to e ach other. If the sphere is on the
                pedestal, the inside of the sphere is explored. If the sphere is in space, the sound space is also the
