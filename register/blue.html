            <h2>_about</h2>
            <p>As part of the module, we dealt with impulses that are evoked in us by the environment or objects around
                us. One such impulse was a trench we found in an abandoned military installation in Pula, Cro- atia. In
                the second part of the module, we got to adapt the project to our school environment.
                The tower-staircase in ZHdK inspired our vision. A place that is usually used for transfer was given a
                new meaning by placing 3D objects into a digital space. This AR experience offered a space for
                playfulness and curiosity .
                The visitors attempted to look at the objects from different perspec- tives and at the same time
                discovered the different characters of the forms through their movement. this behavior of the visitor
                led to a new animation and application of the staircase.</p>

            <p>Pooya is an autonomous robot that humans can interact with by bringing their bodies close to it. This way
                Pooyas path can be al- tered and even controlled. This way Pooya leaves behind a trace of it journey and
                the encounters it had along the way. The chalk trail was chosen for its temporary quality and
                contrasting color to the concrete surface as well as for its playful character. Pooya’s col- lected
                visual impressions combined with the corresponding sound- scapes are recorded and made accessible on a
                website.</p>

            <p>Immerse yourself in a colorful world.
                This immersive light installation plays with projecting and splitting of light. Through a mapping
                program (MadMapper) a rectangle, which changes dimension and colors, is created in the front of the
                scene. panels are attached to both sides of the scren area. A shift- ing color gradient can be seen on
                them. This color gradient is creat- ed by a camera shot of the mapped rectangles. This color spectrum is
                created by a discrepancy in the shutter speed and frame rate of the camera. These settings cause the
                captured light source to split into its existing primary colors of the additive color mixing.

            <p>Ohrbit is an interactive, spatial and immersive sound installation. Consisting of a portable sphere, a
                pedestal and four speakers, a unique sound experience is created. By interacting with the ped- estal or
                rotating the sphere in space, the user can explore the soundscape around them.The installation is
                divided into two sound worlds. They are fundamentally opposed to each other. If the sphere is on the
                pedestal, the inside of the sphere is explored. If the sphere is in space, the soundscape opens up in a
                room experience.</p>

            <h2>_about</h2>
            <p>As part of my essay „ecological sustainability in digital design“, I was thinking about the effects of
                web processes on the environ- ment. I asked myself what knowledge already exists and how this can be
                incorporated into a working prototype. Projects like the web- site of Kris De Decker “LOW TECH
                MAGAZINE”, the book of Tom Greenwood “Sustainable Web Design” or the documentation of an Amazon order by
                the artist Joana Moll , inspired me to dedicate myself to the topic.Therefore decided to challenge
                myself al little bit and create an HTML file that would be as small as possible. If the website would
                run over a server, I would have added a gzip compression, which would lower its impact even further.
